Some terminology
repositories- this is the another name project 
Watch would allow me, when I'm signed in, to watch this repository and, when changes are made, it'll update me, and say, hey, they've changed this. And, that way, I can track a project, and see what kind of changes have been made on it.
Star means I love this thing.
Fork mean, I want to make a copy of this and I want to start working on it myself.
README file :tells you a little bit more about it. It's almost like documentation but it's sort of a big overview of what project is and kind of how it works. 
Wiki. So you can create wikis for your projects so they have like frequently asked questions, and maybe a little bit more documentation, that sort of thing.
